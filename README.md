# jester

A tool for media ingestion and automation.

## Installation

Clone the repository, then navigate a terminal to the repository's root.

Use pip to install:

```
python -m pip install .
```

Then launch the gui:

```
python -m jester gui
```

This will launch the main window with a simple premade node-network I'm using for debugging/testing. Core logic is not implemented yet.
